# Strata on two or three GPUs (layer split)

One model can run across several NVIDIA cards in one PC. The layers are split into contiguous ranges, one per GPU:
the first card runs layers 0 to K-1, the next card runs K onward, and so on; the last card also runs the output head
and the draft (MTP) layer. Each card keeps an expert cache for **its own layers only**, so two cards hold about twice
the experts one card holds - for the Coder model on a 16 GB + 24 GB pair, nearly all of them, which is where the
speed comes from (decode then barely touches the CPU pool).

This is pipeline (layer) parallelism, not tensor parallelism: a token crosses from one card to the next once per
verify window (a few hundred KB through pinned RAM), not twice per layer. No NVLink or peer-to-peer access is
needed; cards on x4 or x1 slots work, and the PCIe share of each card is probed on its own link. A `--pcie-frac` you give
is every card's share and skips those probes; there is no per-card setting yet.

## Using it

**Nothing to type.** `START-HERE.bat` (Linux: `./setup.sh`) lists your NVIDIA cards and says for each one whether
Strata can use it:

```
  Your NVIDIA GPUs:
    GPU 0: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080, 16 GB VRAM - can be used
    GPU 1: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti, 11 GB VRAM - not supported - older than the RTX 20 series (compute capability 6.1; Strata needs 7.5 or newer)
    GPU 2: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, 24 GB VRAM - can be used
  ...
  1) GPU 0 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080, 16 GB) + GPU 2 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, 24 GB) together   (recommended)
  2) GPU 2 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090, 24 GB) only
  3) GPU 0 (NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5080, 16 GB) only
Which GPUs? [1]:
```

When two or more cards can share the model, the two best together are recommended (the newest generation first:
it becomes the main card). A model installed on one card asks once, at its next start, whether to use both from
now on; the answer is kept.

**Choosing yourself** (at setup or at any start):

```
--gpus 0,2                 these cards together, as nvidia-smi numbers them; the first is the main one. Remembered.
--gpus all                 every card that can share the model
--gpu 0                    one card (at a start: for that start only)
--layer-split auto         (default) or the first layer of each later card, e.g. 18 or 16,32
```

**Not supported** (setup says so and names the cards that can be used instead):
- a card older than the RTX 20 series (compute capability below 7.5: GTX 10 and older);
- a card with less than 8 GB of VRAM, together with others (each card holds a copy of the dense weights and its
  own prompt buffers) - unless you name it with `--gpus`: then setup says the risk and asks (`--yes` with the named
  cards goes ahead);
- Intel GPUs, and a mix of NVIDIA and AMD cards. (AMD cards share a model among themselves: `./setup.sh --backend
  hip --gpus 1,0`, see [AMD_HIP.md](AMD_HIP.md).)

Or edit an existing config (`strata-*.json`), then restart:

```json
"gpu": [0, 2],
"layer_split": "auto"
```

`"layer_split"` is `"auto"` (placed by each card's free VRAM) or the **first layer of each later card**: one rising
number per card after the first, not a count of layers per card. With 4 cards and a 48-layer model, `"24,36,42"`
(or `[24, 36, 42]`) puts layers 0-23 on the first card, 24-35 on the second, 36-41 on the third and 42-47 on the last.
The server checks it before the start and says what is wrong (0.1.39, #644).

**Skip the split when the first card holds everything** (opt-in, 0.1.31): `"split_skip_if_fits": true` in the config
(engine flag `--split-skip-if-fits`, with `--layer-split auto`) runs on the first card alone when it holds every
profiled expert plus the context's KV, the draft layer and the reserve, and says so in the log; otherwise the split
stays. On an R9700 32 GB + RX 9070 XT the R9700 holds all of the Coder's experts: with the flag 4K prompts read at
1,776 tok/s instead of 1,244 (split) and decode runs at ~60 tok/s instead of ~51 (16K prompts ~5% slower than split).

**Short prompts on a split (0.1.32, #340).** 0.1.30 gave each card's prompt path a loan from its own expert cache,
refilled after every request; on cards that hold nearly all their experts that cost short prompts up to a third of
their speed. 0.1.32 refills all cards at once, uses a smaller streaming ring on a split, and lets a card with free
VRAM keep its own prompt buffers - the same output as 0.1.31, measured on an R9700 + RX 9070 XT: 2K prompts 993 ->
1,265 tok/s, 16K 1,852 -> 1,950, decode unchanged. `STRATA_SPLIT_OWN=1` (opt-in) gives every card its own buffers:
2K 1,450 and 16K 2,227 tok/s there, but a full card then keeps a different set of experts resident, so the output
differs from the default's (stable and coherent); `STRATA_SPLIT_OWN=auto` does that only where the buffers are at
most 12% of each card's VRAM.

**Tune the streamed expert ring on a split.** `STRATA_SPLIT_RING=N` sets the
ring to N expert slots when the engine starts. `STRATA_SPLIT_RING=0` uses the
normal ring rule. It does not turn streaming off. `STRATA_PREFILL_RING`, if set,
takes precedence. Each slot holds one whole expert blob. The ring borrows
capacity from the stage's expert cache during prefill. A smaller ring leaves
more experts resident but gives the copy stream less lookahead.

On two V100 16 GB cards with Gen3 x4 and x16 links, a native IQ3_S pack and
layer split 16, the 192-slot ring improved 4K prefill by 4.68% in the initial
test and 5.39% in a confirmation test against 384 slots. 32K prefill was
unchanged. A 96-slot ring reduced 32K prefill, and DMA decode was slower than
the automatic mechanism. These tests show no decode gain and do not rule out
a decode regression. Keep the ring setting opt-in for short-prompt prefill.
At benchmark time, the private runtime configuration and engine defaults were
unchanged; the tests used a separate IQ3_S server. The installed V100 deployment
now sets `STRATA_SPLIT_RING=192` in its boot template (`strata-v100.service`);
see [Starting the V100 IQ3_S server as a user service](DETAILS.md#starting-the-v100-iq3_s-server-as-a-user-service).
This remains an opt-in short-prompt prefill setting, not a universal default.
See the [expert transfer report](../benchmarks/v100-iq3_s-expert-transfer-2026-10-06.md)
for the measurements, correctness limits, and reproduction commands.

**CPU assistance for short prefill chunks (opt-in).**

Set `STRATA_PREFILL_CPU_SHARE=auto` to let all eligible layer-split stages use
the existing CPU expert pool during prefill. A fraction selects a fixed share;
unset or `0` keeps CPU sharing off. This option requires native expert formats,
pinned resident host blobs, and prompt chunks below 1,024 tokens. It is not
enabled with batch slots, `--no-pool`, or an active peer-expert path.

Overlapping GPU stages serialize complete CPU batches on one pool. They do not
create a worker pool per GPU. The prefill chain drains before decode resumes.
Read-only pinned expert lookups do not change source counters or staging state.

On two V100 16 GB cards and a Ryzen 5 3600, three interleaved pairs measured
34.7% lower median prefill latency at 256 tokens and 37.4% at 600 tokens.
The 2K control was approximately unchanged. Keep automatic chunk sizing;
forcing 512-token chunks is not a recommended long-prompt optimization.

CPU and GPU activation formats and rounding differ. Answers need not be
byte-identical, and automatic sharing can vary between runs. The default stays
off. See the [measurement and ownership report](../benchmarks/v100-multi-gpu-cpu-prefill-2026-10-07.md)
for the regression, overlap, cancellation, and service checks.

**Retained CPU-pool changes.** The pool keeps the model formats, the int8 KV
cache at a 524,288-token context, vision, MTP, the L2/L3 conversation tiers and
the NVMe-backed n-gram table. No 20% end-to-end gain is proved yet, and no
performance guarantee follows.

On a CPU with AVX2, no AVX-512 and no AVX-VNNI, the AVX-2 expert kernel serves
IQ3_XXS, IQ3_S and IQ2_S rows for one token (NT1) by default. NT means the
tokens in one group; NT1 is a group of one token. The IQ3_S and IQ2_S decodes
use 32-bit loads to read packed index bytes. These rows reduce in ggml's own
float order and apply the format normalization factor after the reduction, so a
row is ggml's dot product bit for bit, including subnormal products. IQ4_NL down
rows are unchanged. An explicit `STRATA_IQ_MT_MIN` keeps its rule.

After each non-host physical core has a worker, the pool pins additional
workers to the allowed SMT siblings of the worker cores. SMT (simultaneous
multithreading) means a physical core's second logical processor. The host
core's sibling comes last, so an additional worker shares the host's physical
core only after every worker sibling is taken. The default placement is
unchanged.

**L3 background-writer affinity.** The two asynchronous NVMe park writers, the
conversation delta park and the L3 root-prefix park, restore the allowed CPUs at
the start of the writer thread, because a new thread inherits the serving
thread's pin to the reserved host core (the first physical core, logical
processor 0). The pool captures the allowed CPUs at construction, before that
pin; each writer, created later on the pinned thread, captures a copy and
restores it at entry. The GPU host thread stays pinned. The L2 parking, the
snapshot format, the FNV hash, the disk budgets and the order of the future
writes are unchanged. A strace smoke on two NVMe conversation files: the old
writer inherits mask [0] with no restore. Each new writer restores [0..11]
before its file open. Each restore returns 0 on the measured machine (six cores, 12
threads). The RAM A/B/A reuse was 4615 of 4620 tokens in both arms. The trace
is not timing evidence. The matched HTTP study does not meet the 20% target.
See the [CPU and SSD study](../benchmarks/v100-iq3_s-prefill-wmma.md#cpu-and-ssd-study-2026-10-10).


**The idle card can help one-chunk prompts (opt-in, `STRATA_PREFILL_HELP=1`).** A prompt that fits one chunk runs the stages one after the other, so while
one card reads its layers the other idles. With it on, each stage hands a share of its streamed experts to the idle card: it
streams them over its own PCIe link into its own (lent) prompt buffers, computes their rows on the MMQ path and sends
them back - `--peer-device`'s peer streaming, without P2P (the activations and the rows go through mapped host memory,
read by copy kernels, so they do not queue behind the expert blobs on either card's copy engine). The share falls with
the prompt (0.41 of the streamed experts at 1.5K tokens, 0.32 at 3K) and is off from ~3.3K tokens, where the stages
overlap anyway and no share paid. Measured on 2x RTX 3090 (UD-Q4_K_XL, no P2P), prompt tok/s without / with: 1.1K 496 /
723, 1.5K 674 / 833, 2K 878 / 1,128, 2.5K 1,017 / 1,296, 3K 1,260 / 1,440; 4K and 8K unchanged, decode unchanged. It
costs no VRAM (the idle card's own prompt buffers) and ~110 KB of mapped host memory per token of the largest chunk it
helped (~360 MB at 3.3K tokens). The rows it computes round like a different MMQ grouping, so the output is not
bit-identical to the default's (it is repeatable: same prompt, same output), which is why it is **opt-in**:
`STRATA_PREFILL_HELP=1` turns it on. On this fork's two V100s the option measured no
meaningful prefill gain, so it stays off there. Native packs on the MMQ prompt path only (not with the fused prompt kernels,
`STRATA_PF_FUSED=1`, nor with `--peer-device`). With it on, `STRATA_PREFILL_HELP_FRAC=f` fixes the share.
The engine flags behind it: `--layer-split K1[,K2..]|auto` and `--split-device D1[,D2..]` (the later stages'
devices; default the next visible ones). `--layer-split K --split-device 0` runs both stages on one card sharing
everything - the bit-exact check of the hand-off, not a speed mode.

**Each card loads only its own layers' dense weights** with explicit split points (`--layer-split
27`, not `auto`). This fork retains its existing stage-local weight loading. It releases VRAM for
the expert cache. A different set of resident experts can change output rounding.

**The resident RAM mode works on a split** (`--resident-experts`, the low-RAM mode). The RAM copy of the experts
leaves out the ones every card's cache holds, not only the first card's, and when the rest does not fit whole it keeps
the hottest by the expert profile over all the layers. An adaptive swap copies the evicted expert back into RAM from
the card that owns its layer. Before, `--resident-experts` with a split ran as `--mmap-experts`, and setup recommended
one card in the low-RAM mode; with an engine that has it (`RESIDENT_SPLIT_ENGINE` in setup.py), setup keeps the cards
together and the experts no card holds in RAM. Swift 1.5 IQ3_XXS at
160K (q4_0 KV, `--prefill 4096`, `--spec 4` with the stock draft layer), RTX 4060 Ti (layers 0-19) + RTX 5080 (20-47),
i9-14900KF, 32 GB of RAM, Windows 11, four greedy prompts at a time, decode tok/s:

| | first four prompts | after three more rounds |
|---|---|---|
| 5080 alone, `--resident-experts` | 25 | 29 |
| split, `--mmap-experts` (what `--resident-experts` became on a split) | 32 | 64 |
| split, `--resident-experts` (22 GiB of experts locked in RAM) | 71 | 69 |

The split with `--mmap-experts` catches up once the OS file cache holds the experts, on a PC with nothing else
running; the resident copy is there from the first request and stays locked when other programs need the RAM. With
`--pcie-frac 0 --adapt-every 0` the split's greedy output is the same with either mode.

**A separate VRAM reserve for the later cards:** `--vram-reserve-later-mib N` (default: `--vram-reserve-mib`'s value).
The card that drives the monitors needs more headroom than one that drives none; with the display on the last card,
`--vram-reserve-mib 300 --vram-reserve-later-mib 1800` gives the first card's cache that VRAM.

**auto** tries every placement (all of them for two, three or, since 0.1.40, four cards; beyond that the layers are
shared in proportion to card speed) and keeps the one whose predicted decode-window time is lowest: each card's
per-layer time (less on a card with more SMs and a higher clock) plus the routed mass its caches would miss, hottest
profile pairs weighted most. It is a decode-cost model, not a prompt-bandwidth one. The startup log prints the choice:

```
strata generate: layer split auto: K=22 - predicted 19.7 ms per decode window; the caches hold 11298 of 12288 profiled pairs (~99.7% of the routed mass)
strata serve: layer split: layers 0-21 (CUDA0), 22-47 (CUDA1), one hand-off per window
```

**PCIe share, per card:** without `--pcie-frac`, every card probes its own host-to-device link. A slower link
gets a smaller share of the missed experts. An explicit startup `--pcie-frac` value applies to every card.
A request's `pcie_frac` value overrides every stage only when it differs from the first card's startup share.
Otherwise, later cards keep their own startup shares.

## What each card holds

- **every card**: the canonical weights and native dense projections of its OWN layers (an explicit split
  loads only those; auto placements keep the full tables), its own session state
  (the KV cache of the full context), its verify window and its prompt-path buffers, and an expert cache for
  its layers filled from the profile;
- **the last card**: also the output head and the draft layer (~0.8 GB);
- **host RAM**: the expert arena once, shared by all cards (the CPU pool computes whatever no card holds).

Prompts are read in chunks that flow through the cards in turn; while a later card reads chunk c, the first card
already reads chunk c+1. Conversation checkpoints save and restore every card's state; the adaptive expert swaps copy
into the card that owns the layer.

The opt-in conversation cache disk store (`--conversation-cache-disk`) saves that state in files: one record per
conversation, with one image per stage. It accepts `--layer-split`, unlike the host-RAM conversation cache.

## Limits (for now)

- **Works across cards** (bench/results/2026-09-29-layer-split-limits):
  - images (`--vision`): each card keeps its own image-position table;
  - control vectors and the experimental speed projection: each card holds the vector's tables, switched on and
    off per request on all of them;
  - KV streaming (`--kv-resident`): each card streams the KV of its own session;
  - the conversation cache disk store (`--conversation-cache-disk`): one record per conversation holds one image
    per stage; a run reuses a record only when the layer split, the devices, and the other compatibility inputs
    match;
  - the MTP draft layer's own K/V: when a window is set and is smaller than the context (`--mtp-window`;
    default 32,768 cells; a window of 0, or at least the context, keeps the draft layer's K/V fully in VRAM),
    the draft layer's K/V is a ring of that window over its own pinned host copy, independent of
    `--kv-resident`. The host copy holds the WHOLE context in RAM (it is the basis for refilling the ring on a
    resume; no part of it is reduced). If the host copy cannot be pinned, the draft layer's K/V stays fully in
    VRAM. With the ring the draft attends only the last window's cells - a longer window holds more of the
    context at the cost of more VRAM only; the pinned host copy always holds the whole context, whatever the
    window;
  - mid-prompt checkpoints (`--prompt-cache-every`): each card saves its part of a checkpoint when it has read that
    chunk;
  - the older helper-GPU caches (`--expert-cache-remote`, docs/SECOND_GPU.md): they take the visible GPUs no stage
    runs on, and hold only experts no stage's cache holds. On the test rig, a 2080 Ti helper made decoding slower,
    as it did without a split: its per-layer round trip costs more than the CPU pool needs for those experts.
- `--mmap-experts` needs a canonical pack (`experts.bin`), with or without a split; a native (IQ) pack says so at
  start.
- The prompt path has its own buffers on every card (1.5 GB each at the default 2048-token chunk; `--prefill 1024`
  halves that) instead of borrowing cache slots as one card does. An explicit `--expert-cache` on the first card is
  capped to leave room for them.
- Under WDDM (Windows, and WSL2) only 8 GiB of the expert arena is pinned (more, mapped into two GPU contexts,
  leaves WDDM refusing allocations); the rest streams through the pinned staging ring. A Linux driver has no such
  limit, so there the whole arena is pinned (since 0.1.31; the cap cost a 4090 + 3060 split two thirds of its
  prompt speed, #253). `STRATA_ARENA_PIN_GIB=N` pins at most N GiB, `0` the whole arena, on any OS.
- Every card needs compute capability 7.5 (RTX 20 or newer). The pre-sm_80 QSA scorer path is fp32 FMAs, so a
  Turing card runs the same kernels instead of the tensor-core prompt attention.

- With an expert profile (the default), every stage's prompt path borrows the tail of its own expert cache for its
  chunk buffers and refills it after the prompt; outside the prompt the whole cache is expert cache again, so the
  buffers cost a stage no permanent VRAM. Without a profile, or with `--no-prefill-borrow`, each stage keeps its
  own chunk-sized buffers for the whole session instead; then an explicit `--expert-cache` is capped to leave room
  for them.
- Every stage leaves room for its verify windows (~96 MiB) before its cache is sized; the draft layer and the head
  (~1 GiB) sit on the last stage only.
- Under WDDM (Windows, and WSL2) only 8 GiB of the expert arena is pinned (more, mapped into two GPU contexts,
  leaves WDDM refusing allocations); the rest streams through the pinned staging ring. A Linux driver has no such
  limit, so there the whole arena is pinned. `STRATA_ARENA_PIN_GIB=N` pins at most N GiB, `0` the whole arena, on
  any OS. Only registered layers can use direct PCIe copies; unregistered ones use the existing CPU and
  host-staging paths.
- Every card needs compute capability 7.0 (Volta or newer). The build includes code for each selected card's
  architecture; Ampere-only prompt kernels automatically use their portable fallback on Volta and Turing.

**Decode runs the stages one after another.**  A verify window finishes on one card before the next card starts
its share: the hand-off is one per window (a few hundred KB through pinned RAM).  Prompts gain from the split -
each card reads its own layers of a chunk while the previous card reads the next chunk - but decode is the sum
of the stages, not the longer one.  With two equal cards each card is busy about half the time during decode
(measured on a pair of V100 16 GB: one card at 100% util while the other idles, alternating per window).

Inside a window, each layer's hyper-connection read and its K/V append run as a small fixed set of launches,
whatever the window's size:

- **Hyper-connection read (the hc-read halves).** The read computes the norm, the low-rank down projection and
  the up projection once per layer half.  On a Volta card (sm_70) a group of up to 8 tokens (a group is
  the window, or its half under `--spec-split`) is read in two kernels: the down launch runs the original
  scalar down body once per token. Each block handles one token and one group of 8 projection rows.
  The block recomputes its token's norm with the unchanged 8-warp mapping. There is no separate norm launch and
  the normalized input never round-trips through global memory; the up kernel follows.  Every token's
  outputs are bit-identical to the scalar kernel's.  Every other architecture keeps the original
  three-launch read.
- **K/V append.** Each verify group uses one append launch for Q8, Q4 or FP16 KV. Hybrid KV uses one
  launch for K8 and one for V4. Each token reads its own position record and writes a separate cell.
  The append also writes the host copy when one exists. The quantization arithmetic is the same as
  the single-token append. Page boundaries and rejected-tail overwrite have parity checks.

The host thread that drives the windows is pinned to its own core and spins while it waits for the GPU
(`SessionLoopScratch`, `Verifier::run`); on that rig the wait is 11.3 ms of every 33.6 ms window, against 0.7 ms
of per-layer host work and ~1.3 ms of card-side flag waits.  The pinned core is by design and is not the decode
limit: the GPU is the critical path, and moving the loop's work onto more cores changed no throughput (see the
measured section).  The open limit is pipelining a window's positions across the hand-off - the next card starts
position t while the previous card still runs position t+1 - which would make decode the longer stage instead of
the sum.
## Measured

The Coder on an RTX 5080 + RTX 3090 (Ryzen 9 9950X3D), 32K context; details in
`bench/results/2026-09-29-layer-split/`:

| | Prompt 16K / 28K tok/s | Decode story / code tok/s |
|---|---|---|
| 5080 alone | 1,726-2,017 / 1,970 | 83-87 / 88-105 |
| 5080 + 3090, best split (K=26) | 2,039 / 2,357 | 84 / 110 |
| 5080 + 3090, auto (K=22) | 2,037 / 2,073 | 80 / 109 |

- **Prompts gain the most** (+18-20%): each card reads its own layers of the chunk while the other reads the next.
- **Decode is on par with the faster card alone**, and ahead on code. Once both caches hold nearly every routed
  expert, the per-layer GPU time decides.
- **Correctness:** one GPU is byte-identical to 0.1.20, and the hand-off itself is bit-exact.
- **Two equal cards** (a V100 16 GB pair, Qwen3.8-Flash-Next Q2_0, 4K prompts, `--layer-split 20`): decode at
  55-58 tok/s against 19-22 tok/s on one card alone - the split nearly triples decode here because a second
  cache cuts the missed expert mass the CPU pool computes (hit rate 0.93-0.98 vs 0.73).  The stages still run
  one after the other, so two equal cards do not double decode: the per-window time is the sum of the two
  stages and each card is busy about half the time.  The windows drove the host thread's pinned core to a full
  spin while the GPU ran, and the speed did not change when that work could have spread across cores - the
  card-side flag waits on the host (waitA + waitB + waitCPU) total ~1.3 ms of every 33.6 ms window.
- **The hc read on the pair** (captured-event fixture: seed 99, bf16 weights, native 2560/4/320, window
  sizes 1 to 8): per-call GPU microseconds, original vs fused two-kernel read on each card:

  | T | old GPU0 | new GPU0 | old GPU1 | new GPU1 |
  |---|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|
  | 1 | 61.9     | 42.2     | 60.5     | 40.6     |
  | 2 | 71.3     | 50.0     | 69.8     | 48.5     |
  | 3 | 79.3     | 56.3     | 77.6     | 54.2     |
  | 4 | 87.8     | 78.6     | 86.4     | 74.0     |
  | 5 | 97.7     | 85.6     | 95.8     | 83.9     |
  | 6 | 105.7    | 90.2     | 104.0    | 88.1     |
  | 7 | 115.2    | 94.7     | 113.6    | 93.2     |
  | 8 | 124.9    | 116.2    | 123.1    | 113.8    |

  The old and new full output dumps of the eight windows are byte-identical (3,360,768 bytes in all);
  scalar parity, capture replay and no-inject checks all pass, and the six selected kernel ctests
  (kv q8/q4/stream/hybrid parity, gr parity, qsa parity) pass on the final build.  A captured-event
  fixture measures kernel latency, not throughput - it is not proof of a runtime gain.

### V100 runtime comparison

**Historical (1 October 2026).** This comparison preceded the upstream v0.1.39
integration and measured the fork's fused Volta GR / batched KV-append work
against the v0.1.36-line runtime installed before it. It is kept with its
original provenance; the v0.1.39 build is the subject of the prefill A/B in

The final comparison uses two V100 PCIe 16 GB cards. GPU0 has a Gen3 x2 link.
GPU1 has a Gen3 x16 link. The model is Qwen3.8-Flash-Next Q2_0. The layer split
is 20/28. Main KV is int8 with a 262,144-token capacity. Vision stays enabled.
Prefill chunk size and expert placement use their automatic settings.

Each prompt size has three fresh requests and 256 output tokens per request.
No request reuses prompt tokens. Seed 1001 controls the prompt generator, not
the model sampler. The server uses greedy sampling. The table shows medians
in tokens per second against the installed runtime before these changes.

| Prompt target | Prefill before | Prefill after | Decode before | Decode after | Decode change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 4K | 441.8 | 442.6 | 61.0 | 64.4 | +5.6% |
| 8K | 619.7 | 621.0 | 58.7 | 68.0 | +15.8% |
| 16K | 818.9 | 820.3 | 56.6 | 66.4 | +17.3% |
| 32K | 974.4 | 977.1 | 58.6 | 66.8 | +14.0% |

The goal of a 20% gain in both paths at all four sizes was not met. Prefill
throughput is approximately unchanged. A 14/34 split with a 12,288-token
prefill chunk raised short-prompt prefill to 650.4/778.4 tokens per second,
but reduced 32K prefill to 839.9. The installed configuration keeps the
original split and automatic chunk size. No rejected tuning flag is enabled.

The final build passed six kernel parity tests. GR memory and synchronization
checks reported zero errors. A live request passed the draft ring boundary
with 53,508 prompt tokens and 256 output tokens. Its direct prefix extension
restored a 49,152-token checkpoint and produced 128 output tokens. Main KV
stayed in VRAM for both requests.

Kernel byte parity does not establish identical generated text for all
placements. A fixed no-PCIe-miss control matched all three completion hashes.
Other controls changed expert-cache capacity and could change CPU/GPU
arithmetic. An original-versus-original restart also changed one completion.

Raw matrices, comparison data and verification details are in
`bench/results/2026-10-01-v100-autonomous/`. To repeat the four-size matrix,
use `bench/run_v100_bench.py --model qwen --targets 4096,8192,16384,32768
--seed 1001 --repeats 3 --max-tokens 256` with the model GGUF and output
directory options for the local installation.

**Which cards and in what order:**
- Put the fastest card first; auto gives it as many layers as its cache allows.
- Leave out a much slower card when two already hold the model. An RTX 2080 Ti as a third card made the 5080 +
  3090 pair slower (68 / 90 tok/s decode): every extra card costs its own round per window.
- More cards pay off when the model's routed experts do not fit the faster ones.

## One conversation with both cards busy (`--pipeline-windows`, opt-in)

With a split the cards take turns on a verify window: the first card runs its layers and hands off, then waits while
the last card runs the rest, the head and the draft. `--pipeline-windows 2` lets the first card start the **next**
window while the last card still verifies this one. The next window is a guess: that this window is accepted whole
and that its bonus token is the one the draft layer predicts (the draft layer is run on through the drafts of the
window in flight). When the guess holds, half of the next window is already done; when it does not, the first card
puts its state back (a copy of its recurrent state taken while the window ran) and the next window is built from the
real tokens. A guessed window is only started when the draft layer's estimate says it is likely to be kept. Windows
copied from earlier context (`--suffix-draft`) are guessed past as well, which is where edits that copy text gain
most. `--pipeline-windows 1` overlaps only the short prompt reads that go through the verify windows
(`--short-read`).

Two cards, exactly two stages, `--serve`. In the config:

```
"args": [ ..., "--pipeline-windows", "2" ],
"layer_split": "20"
```

- **Cost**: a second verify window on each card, 160 MiB more kept out of each card's expert cache, plus two copies
  of the first card's recurrent state (about 3 MiB per GDN layer it runs) on the first card with `2`.
- **Same text**: the last card only ever runs windows that are verified, and every window row computes what it
  would in any other window, so the tokens are the serial loop's. With `STRATA_IQ_MT_MIN=1 --pcie-frac 0
  --adapt-every 0` the greedy output is identical bit for bit to the serial loop's with the same expert caches. The pipeline keeps
  its VRAM out of the caches, so against a run without the flag a few experts move from a card to the CPU, which
  rounds them differently, and a near-tie can flip (a serial run given the same caches through `--vram-reserve-mib`
  matches it exactly).
- **Off, with one line in the log saying why**, with `--batch` slots, `--peer-device`, the helper caches
  (`--expert-cache-device1..3`, `--remote-expert-opt`), a split into three or more stages or onto one GPU
  (`--split-device 0`), or no draft layer. A request with repetition penalties (`penalty_last_n`) or coupled
  draft sampling decodes serially.
- **Measured** (Swift 1.5 IQ3_XXS, 160K context, q4_0 KV, the stock draft layer, RTX 4060 Ti (layers 0-19) +
  RTX 5080 (20-47), i9-14900KF, 32 GB of RAM with the resident RAM mode on the split (#848); greedy, 500 tokens, two
  interleaved pairs of three rounds, decode tok/s): Python code 90.4 -> 103.1, C code 76.6 -> 81.6, English prose
  63.0 -> 71.1, Italian prose 41.6 -> 46.3, a copy-heavy edit (a 5 KB file back with a rename) 90.5 -> 117.9; mean
  72.4 -> 84.0 (+16%). It pays when the windows are GPU-bound: with the experts read through the OS file cache
  (`--mmap-experts` on that 32 GB PC) the file reads dominate and it measured no faster.

The `STRATA_PIPELINE_*` tuning and test variables (THETA, FORCE_MISS, SWITCH, LOG, TRACE and the like) are read only with
`STRATA_PIPELINE_DEBUG=1`. `--pipeline-windows` and `--adapt-async 1` exclude each other (the engine says so and keeps the
pipeline).

## Several conversations at once

With a layer split, `--batch N --batch-groups G` decodes several conversations together and
pipelines them through the cards: see [BATCHING.md](BATCHING.md). The slot sessions are
carved after a stage's own session, the head and the MTP draft layer, so on a split the
fit check sees the memory really left on every card - including the last stage, where the
draft sits. A count that does not fit falls back to fewer slots, or to one request at a
time, at startup, with the configuration untouched (observed on this rack's 20/28 split
at the 524,288-token context; the final admission-time figures are in the benchmark
report).
